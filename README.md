# Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

## Objective
To visualize sales data and identify key business insights using Tableau.

## Tools Used
- **Tool:** Tableau Public
- **Dataset:** Sample Superstore

## Visualizations Created
I created a dashboard consisting of two main charts:

1. **Sales by Category (Bar Chart):**
   - This chart breaks down the total revenue generated by different product categories (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies).
   - **Insight:** Technology is the highest-performing category in terms of sales volume.

2. **Profit by Region (Map):**
   - This geographical map visualizes profit across different states. Colors indicate profitability (darker colors = higher profit).
   - **Insight:** While overall sales are high, specific states show negative profit margins, suggesting efficiency issues in those locations.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that while revenue is strong in Technology, we need to investigate the specific regions that are failing to generate profit to improve the overall bottom line.
